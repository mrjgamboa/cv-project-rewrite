## Description

This online application was created to complete the "[Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)" assignment from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The project was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses functional components and useState hook.
